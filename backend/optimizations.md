Some routes like controllers/template.go and controllers/workout.go load related data which could benefit from optimized preloading.

Missing Indexes
The database models lack explicit indexes for frequently queried fields
Recommendation: Add indexes to foreign keys and frequently filtered columns

The code doesn't explicitly sanitize inputs beyond validation, potentially allowing injection attacks in search parameters.

Context: Project Context:
A daily workout tracker web app called "Trackle".

Features:
1. I should be able to login and signup.
2. I want to track daily workout here using a template(defined by me). Template can be created using a pre-defined list of workouts and custom number of sets per workout.
3. In order to track a workout, you have to select from one of the templates. And then you can add the weights used for each set.
4. I should be able to see the history of all my workouts.

Task: Create a frontend in the root directory (frontend folder) using React in TypeScript. The UI should be responsive and able to view properly on mobile screen too. Keep the UI aesthetic, professional and modern. 

1. Home page
2. Login and Register page
3. Templates page (view all and create template) (delete option should only be visible after going into the template)
4. Workout page (create and view all workouts) (delete option should only be visible after going into the workout)
5. Workout statistics page
